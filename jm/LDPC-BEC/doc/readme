  Introduction

    The purpose of this readme is to present a test procedure for verifying that the EE 567 (LDPC-BEC) job
    manager is working properly.  This job manager is used in Dr. Valenti's EE 567 course and enables
    students to simulate LDPC codes using the WCRL computing cluster.


  Prerequisites

    Administrative access to the WCRL WCTC web application and PCS account on the cluster
       If you don't have access to these accounts, contact Dr. Valenti and request them.
 
 
    
    

  Procedure

    1. Start the job manager.

       Log in to the cluster as the pcs user
         
         > ssh pcs@wcrl.csee.wvu.edu

       Start the LDPC-BEC job manager in the short queue.
 
         > pcs short start LDPC-BEC



    2. Log in to the WCTC web interface at URL
   
        http://wcrl.csee.wvu.edu/wctc

       if you can't log in, contact Dr. Valenti for an account.  

  

    3. Ensure that your user account is enrolled in the LDPC-BEC project
        Users > click on your username > Add project "LDPC-BEC" to subscribed projects



    4. Create a test project

         Click the "Jobs" tabs
  
         Click the "Add job" button

         Select project "LDPC-BEC" 

         Select job file
 	   TESTn1000IRA.mat
         stored in the directory containing this readme.
  
         The job should beging executing.

  
     5. Wait for the job to complete.

        Select the "Jobs" tab and select project "LDPC-BEC".

	The job should appear as an item in this window and will
	update its status as results accumulate.

        If no other jobs are executing on the cluster, the test job
	should take 10-15 minutes to complete.

        Once complete, click the job.  Under the item "Files",
	the following files should be displayed
 	   TESTn1000IRA.mat
           TESTn1000IRA_Fig1.pdf
           TESTn1000IRA_Fig2.pdf
       
        Download the files and verify that their contents are correct.
